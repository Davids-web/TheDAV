The school has 260 pupils on roll (who all attend free of charge). The school is attended by 
all the children from the orphanage ages 3 â€“ 15 and many children from disadvantaged backgrounds 
in the local area that would not be able to access any other education mainly due to the costs involved. 
The school at present has 10 permanent staff who are paid for by UCGA, which also finances all the 
things necessary for a school to function such as text books, exercise books, stationery equipment, etc. 
UCGA also finances the up keep and development of the building to ensure that the school meets both 
the educational and structural requirements of the government, so that it can keep its status as a 
recognized educational establishment.
